            Hey there! My name is Gregory Stocker and I am a Software Engineer.
            I will be graduating from Arizona State University in May 2023. I have
            experience in Web Development, Mobile Development and am learning Embedded Development. 
            The main languages that I use are C, MySQL, JavaScript and Java, but 
            I also dabble in Python and Bash Scripting. My favorite operating system at the moment is Ubuntu, and my 
            favorite version control system is Git!
